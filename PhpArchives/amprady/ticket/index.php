<body><div align="center"><p><b><u>PLAY WITH DATABASE</u></b></p></div><hr/>
<p>This is a Demo for INTERACTING WITH DATABASE. First link is for the website's admin and second link is open to all users. This is done with PHP/MySQL combination.</p> <p>As mentioned above, this is demo page open to all web users. So come on and play with the Database. Let me explain you how this works. This has two portals - Member Portal and Admin Portal. This is about anouncing a Prize for your customers randomly or by means of distributing coupons.<br/><u>CONCEPT OF THE PLAY:</u><br/>
  A Website has a member/admin portal asusual, and sends monthly newsletter to all of its users. The owner wishes to add a feature that some of the newsletter will be containing a COUPON with a CODE in it. The member has to login the site and provide the obtained CODE to know what PRIZE he has WON. Now, keeping this as example scenario, i've developed pages for both admin and member without login for everyone to see how it works.</p>
<hr /><p><b>1. Check ur prizes here: <a href="chkprize.php">click here</a></b><br/>
</p>
<ul><li>this is member portal or also to be displayed for all guest viewers if needed.</li><li>as a member, if u hav any coupon provided by the website owner, can enter the CODE to see what you u have won as a prize.</li><li>after viewing the prize won, u can enter your details (name/email/address) for the website owner to contact you.</li></ul><hr /><p><b>2. Create table of Golden ticket Codes & its prizes here: <a href="createticket.php">click here</a></b><br/><ul><li>This is Admin Portal</li><li>Follow the above link for you add prizes for your customers coming with a code given in the coupon/ticket.</li><li>as an admin, u can add/edit/delete any codes/prizes.</li><li>if any of the prizes are won by your customers, the column WON would display Yes/No according. Default value is No, while creating a code by you in this page.</li></p></ul><hr/><p>This code is developed with PHP and MySQL. And I'm Pradeep, a Freelance Web Designer from Chennai, India.
